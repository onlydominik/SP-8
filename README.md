:wave: Another project based on the one from frontend mentor.

:pushpin: New things:

:unlock: scss partials - I used this method of dividing css into modules, it was impractica to use this method on such a small project.

:unlock: maps - very useful, for example, I created a map with breakpoints and then thanks to @mixin and @content I easily added media queries in other parts of the code.

:pushpin: Problems

:round_pushpin: the only problem comes with dividing everything into partials in such a small card design
